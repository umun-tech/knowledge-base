# Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Basic Git Commands

Here are some basic Git commands you need to know:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository>`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
- `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commits changes with a descriptive message.
- `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.
- `git push`: Pushes committed changes to the remote repository.

## Branching

Branching is a core concept in Git. Here are some commands related to branching:

- `git branch`: Lists all local branches in the current repository.
- `git branch <branch>`: Creates a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switches to a specific branch and updates the working directory.
- `git merge <branch>`: Merges the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch.

## Collaboration

Git allows multiple people to work together on the same project. Here are some commands related to collaboration:

- `git remote add <remote> <url>`: Adds a remote repository.
- `git fetch <remote>`: Fetches all branches and their respective commits from the remote repository.
- `git pull <remote> <branch>`: Fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.
- `git push <remote> <branch>`: Pushes committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository.

## Git vs GitHub

### Git

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. It's designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time, each with their own local version of the project. Changes can be shared between versions of the project, allowing everyone to have the latest updates.

### GitHub

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. In addition to the version control functionality of Git, GitHub includes additional features like bug tracking, task management, and project wikis. GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.

### Bitbucket

Bitbucket is another web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems. Bitbucket offers both commercial plans and free accounts with an unlimited number of private repositories. Bitbucket integrates with other Atlassian software like Jira, HipChat, Confluence (for documentation), and Bamboo (for continuous integration and deployment).

Remember, while Git is the tool, GitHub and Bitbucket are services that host your Git repositories and provide additional features for development and collaboration.
